<h2>Description of Selected Github Repo</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/tirthajyoti/PythonMachineLearning">PythonhMachineLearning</a>:  Practice and tutorial-style notebooks covering wide variety of machine learning techniques. This repo has over 500 stars and forks.<br><br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Python libraries</b> - Jupyter notebooks covering a wide range of functions and operations on the topics of NumPy, Pandans, Seaborn, matplotlib etc.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Regression</b> - linear regression, multi-variate regression, speed comparison of various regression methods, polynomial regression, decision tree and random forest regression, etc.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Classification</b> - Logistic regression/classification, k-nearest neighbor classification, Decision trees and Random Forest, Support vector machine, Naive Bayes classification, etc.<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Clustering</b> - K-means clustering, Affinity propagation (showing its time complexity and the effect of damping factor), Mean-shift technique (showing its time complexity and the effect of noise on cluster discovery), Hierarchical clustering with Dendograms showing how to choose optimal number of clusters, DBSCAN (showing how it can generically detect areas of high density irrespective of cluster shapes, which the k-means fails to do)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Dimensionality reduction</b> - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)<br>
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp <b>Deep Learning/Neural Network</b> - Demo notebook to illustrate the superiority of deep neural network for complex nonlinear function approximation task, Step-by-step building of 1-hidden-layer and 2-hidden-layer dense network using basic TensorFlow methods.
