<p><a href="https://github.com/tirthajyoti/pydbgen">Pydbgen</a>:<br> 
This is a lightweight Python library for generating random database tables. Useful for beginners in data science when they want to create SQL database tables with synthetic data for practicing machine learning and data extraction algorithms. It can generate Pandas DataFrame, MySQL and SQLite tables, and Excel files with random but contextual data such as name, address, city, zip code, telephone number, birthday, license plate, organization, job title, etc.

<p><a href="https://github.com/tirthajyoti/UCI-ML-API">UCI-ML API</a>: <br>
This is a simple and intuitive API written in Python to interface with the famous UC Irvine Machine Learning repository. It can help a user easily search and download relevant datasets or selectively choose a dataset based on its size or machine learning task category (regression or classification or clustering etc.).

<p><a href="https://github.com/tirthajyoti/Design-of-experiment-Python">Design-of-Experiment-Python</a>: <br>
Design of Experiment (DOE) is an important activity for any scientist, engineer, or statistician planning to conduct experimental analysis, especially in this age of rapidly expanding field of data science and associated statistical modeling and machine learning. This set of codes is a collection of functions which wrap around the core packages (pyDOE and DiversiPy) and generate DOE matrices from an arbitrary range of input variables and save on the local disk as CSV or Excel file. It covers <i>factorial designs</i>, <i>response-surface methods (RSM)</i>, and <i>Latin Hypercube sampling</i>.
