<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<h2>Hi, this is Tirthajyoti's Github project pages</h2>

<h2><i>A bit of introduction about myself</i></h2>
<p>
My name is Tirthajyoti Sarkar. I am a semiconductor technologist with 14+ years of experience in power electronics, semiconductor technology development, and product innovation. In particular, I specialize in the design and development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_MOSFET">Trench Power MOSFET</a> technology and products for high-performance <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_electronics">power electronics systems</a>.
</p>

<p> 
<b>I am currently focused on applying data analytics/machine learning to technology and product design.</b>
</p>

<p>
I work as a Senior Principal Engineer at <a href="http://www.onsemi.com">ON Semiconductor</a>. 
<br>I have a Ph.D. in EE from the <a href="http://www.ece.uic.edu">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the <a href="http://www.uic.edu"> University of Illinois at Chicago</a> and a B.Tech in Instrumentation Engineering from the <a href="http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/">Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur.</a>
</p>

<h2><i>My experience with data analytics/machine learning</i></h2>
<p><span style=color:blue><font size="4">My transition from a 'user' of tools to a programmer</font></span>
<p>
<b>Throughout my career, I have worked with complex, high-dimensional scientific and engineering data.</b> I have extracted and analyzed large datasets, created advanced visualizations, and presented insights to my technical teams. But in all those endeavors, I was largely dependent on a fixed set of tools and was never exposed to the true power of underlying mechanics of data analysis.
</p>
<p>However, since last 2 years, I have become keenly interested in the tools and algorithms which work under the hood and this has opened up a world of possibilities for me. I have discovered the joy of not depending on enterprise tools and writing my own functions and codes in languages such as Python or R. This has given me a much broader perspective and much sharper insights into any data related problem. I have actively started contributing to open-source communities by sharing my analytics projects on Github and social forums. In parallel, I have started learning about core algorithms and how they solve the range of analysis and machine learning problems. I am appreciating the whole process deeply and feeling empowered to peel back the layers. <b>Today, I am able to think about a data problem from multiple viewpoints and analyze/model/learm from it with high degree scientific rigor using custom code and algorithms.</b></p>

<p>
Follwoing my passion about AI/ML/data science, in my spare time, I have started working with a AI-driven starup in Palo Alto, CA as a Consulting Scientist. My role is to advise on <b><i>generative models for software test scripts and test data</b></i>, and work with the Natural Language Processing (NLP) team to <b><i>discover hidden patterns in the test scripts of various web-based applications with the eventual goal of automating the testing process</i></b> to the largest extent possible.</p>
